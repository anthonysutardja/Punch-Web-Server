    <h3>What's a bridge?</h3>
    <p>
        We need to communicate to each sensor in the tank through the a device called a bridge. Our sensor devices are ultra-low
        powered so that they can continuously keep monitoring your batches of wine. That means they don't have enough power to reach the
        Internet on their own.

        The bridge relays all the sensor readings to our servers.
